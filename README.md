# Coding School Project

The Project Creator promotes his idea through a custom "project profile page" where he could add photos, videos, description and updates. In addition to that a Project Creator should be able to track the project's financial progress through a dedicated "stats screen". In order to promote his idea, he should be able to share it on mainstream social media (Facebook and Twitter).To motivate backers to contribute, a Project Creator, should offer a number of "funding packages" where each package is accompanied by a reward to the backer.A Project Creator should also be able to register more than one projects and of course, fund other projects too.

A backer should be able to browse all Projects and "invest" on any one he wishes. He can find Projects either through plain text search or by browsing by category, and he should be able to view the siteâ€™s trending projects. A backer should be able to view the projects he funded, observe their progress and be notified when one is completed.

He too, would like to share his experience on the mainstream social media.

The platform itself should also provide a REST API allowing third party integration and app development.

Your client requires that Project creation and backing should be allowed solely to registered users through a secure environment and that all money transactions should be handled by an authorised Payments Institution.
